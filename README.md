Social job search webscraper
==============================

On LinkedIn and similar aggregator websites its difficult to find relevant social tech jobs and receive alerts. As a result, I need to visit multiple websites to find relevant jobs.

This objective of this project is to speed up my job search by creating a script that extracts relevant jobs from websites I currently use for my job search. The end result is a list of relevant jobs with a weblink for more details and possibility to apply.
